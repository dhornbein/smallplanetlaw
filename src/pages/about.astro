      <p>
        We know estate planning isn't just about paperwork — it's about love,
        legacy, and peace of mind. At Small Planet Law, we help Colorado
        families create plans that keep them out of court and out of conflict,
        while reflecting the values that matter most. Founded by attorney Bobbie
        Mooney after over a decade in public service and a career in
        environmental advocacy, our firm blends compassion, clarity, and
        sustainability into everything that we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Small Planet Law, our Life & Legacy Plans go far beyond traditional
        estate planning by protecting children, equipping fiduciaries,
        streamlining decisions, tracking assets, preserving stories and values,
        and keeping every plan up to date so families stay out of court, out of
        conflict, and deeply connected across generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer flat-fee, relationship-based estate planning services and
        options to include sustainability in your legacy, make planning simple,
        personal, and even inspiring. Because protecting your family and our one
        small planet should feel like a gift, not a burden.

            <p>
              At Small Planet Law, I serve conscientious Coloradans who care
              deeply about their loved ones, their legacy, and the future of our
              planet. My clients are the kind of people who show up for their
              families, their communities, and the Earth. And they want their
              estate plan to reflect that same care. I help them do just that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're planning for your children's future, supporting
              aging parents, or simply wanting peace of mind, I offer a
              thoughtful, holistic approach to estate planning that honors what
              matters most: your people, your values, and your vision for a
              better world. My practice includes green estate planning options
              for those who want their legacy to support sustainability, from
              conservation-minded choices to charitable giving aligned with
              environmental causes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up in the rolling hills of northern Vermont, where a deep
              connection to nature and community shaped my lifelong commitment
              to service. That path led me through years of public interest work
              in government and nonprofits, always with a focus on care,
              justice, and environmental stewardship. Founding Small Planet Law
              is my way of bringing those values together to serve families in
              Colorado with compassion, clarity, and integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clients tell me they feel seen, supported, and empowered after
              working together. I bring not only legal expertise, but also a
              grounding in leadership, grief care, and environmental ethics.
              It's my honor to help you protect your life, your legacy, and our
              shared future.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not working with clients, you'll find me enjoying
              Colorado's great outdoors with my husband Dennis and our two young
              sons, supporting local environmental initiatives, or helping
              nonprofits craft powerful advocacy strategies. I'm passionate
              about sustainability, community resilience, and making legal
              services feel human, accessible, and deeply aligned with the
              values we hold dear.
            </p>
